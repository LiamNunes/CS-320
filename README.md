CS-320 classwork

    • How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code is both functional and secure by using what I learned about testing from this class and ensuring I develop tests that will push my program and 
ensure that it has all necessary functionality and that it meets all requirements. 
    • How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
By looking at the users needs I can make a list of all requirements that the user has and also all restrictions the user might have. Then I can develop tests around the 
checklist and ensure that the code that I make meets all of the users needs. 
    • How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software from the bottom up. I think it important to make a list of all the requirements and restrictions before starting then start with a broad 
picture view. Identify the broad strokes of what the project needs to do. Then break that up into classes. Then look at each class and identify what it needs to do. 
Then break that up into methods. Then I look at how the classes and methods will interact with each other. Then once all of that is planned and designed out can I start 
coding.
